# Versioning-Introduction


Hello Github, my name is Manon, and I am glad to join the platform ! Here are my first steps with Git and Github.

I am new at BeCode coding school, and this repository contains the instructions/briefing of our coach and my own cheatsheet about git. Our next challenge will be to elaborate an exquisite corpse, because poetry is everywhere, yes it is. And there will be a proper repo dedicated to it. 

Bisous.
